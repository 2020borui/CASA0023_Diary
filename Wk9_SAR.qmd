# Syntactic Aperture Radar

## Summary

### SAR base background and advantages

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an active remote sensing sensor. Unlike passive sensors that rely on solar radiation, SAR actively emits its own electromagnetic waves and forms images by receiving the backscattered signals from the Earth's surface. This mechanism makes SAR unaffected by cloud and weather, allowing for all-weather observation. SAR improves spatial resolution by synthesising backscatter from multiple observation angles as the sensor moves along its path. In Week 4, I analysed OE data related to flood monitoring. Compared to Landsat 8, SAR data provides greater continuity and reliability, especially in disaster scenarios. This is because SAR can penetrate cloud cover and reduce data loss caused by cloudy or rainy conditions.

### SAR data types and parameter selection

SAR data characteristics are primarily defined by wavelength (band) and polarisation. Common bands include X, C, and L. Wavelength determines the radar's penetration ability: short-wavelength bands (e.g., X-band) are suitable for monitoring surface features, while long-wavelength bands (e.g., L-band) can penetrate vegetation, allowing for the analysis of forest structure.

Polarisation refers to the orientation of the radar wave’s oscillation. Different surface types respond differently to each polarisation mode: VV is sensitive to rough surface scattering, while VH is better suited for detecting volume scattering (e.g., vegetation). The selection of band-polarisation combinations should be made with care for the specific analytical objective.

SAR backscatter intensity can be expressed in three main formats: power, amplitude, and dB, each with different advantages and applications due to SAR’s wide dynamic range.

### SAR data application

SAR applications often rely on comparing images acquired at different times. Differential InSAR (DInSAR) detects ground movement by measuring phase differences between two SAR images acquired at different times. It is commonly used to monitor earthquakes and land subsidence. There are several techniques for detecting changes using SAR data. Unlike optical data, SAR images cannot be simply subtracted due to their multiplicative noise and different statistical characteristics. Commonly used methods include ratio, improved ratio, and log-ratio techniques.

To enhance classification accuracy, SAR imagery is often fused with optical data. Fusion strategies—ranging from decision-level to pixel-level—combine the complementary strengths of both datasets. While decision-level fusion is more accessible and commonly used in GEE, I realised that more complex fusion techniques offer higher precision and will likely be essential in future applications such as agricultural monitoring.

## Application

Remote sensing data play a vital role not only in scientific analysis but also in humanitarian disaster assessment. This week’s lecture illustrates how SAR data can be applied to assess war-related damage. Earth observation (EO) satellite missions offer a cost-effective and repeatable solution for monitoring war impacts. Due to their relatively low spatial resolution, the Landsat series enables faster image processing and lower computational demands. However, its spatial resolution is insufficient for detecting changes at the building level. As a result, it is difficult to assess the extent of structural damage in urban areas. Therefore, war monitoring using Landsat data has focused on broader environmental changes, lacking direct insight into urban structural damage (e.g., buildings). That limits the ability to quantitatively assess socio-economic losses. [@kaplan2022b]

Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 have higher resolution, so they are widely used in the study of urban change and damage to buildings caused by war. Most of the studies apply machine learning techniques to extract image features from Sentinel-2 and polarization features (e.g., VH, HH) from SAR data. Then, classifiers are used to evaluate building damage and classify war-affected areas.[@aimaiti2022; @li2025; @fakhri2021] As previously discussed in Week 3, image features play a key role in urban classification and object identification. In terms of classification accuracy, MS-based data generally has higher overall accuracy than SAR-based data. The VH polarization in SAR data plays the most important role in detecting destroyed buildings. This may be due to their higher sensitivity to structural variations. SAR data is affected by speckle noise at low resolution. MS data captures features well but responds poorly to abrupt structural changes. @li2025 applied a Random Forest model to classify war-related features using fused Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 MS data. Fused data achieved 95.91% accuracy, outperforming MS (95.01%) and SAR (78.65%).

Although many articles emphasise the advantages of SAR's independence from weather. I think the spatial distribution and extent of damage to the building are more important than continuous monitoring over time. @aimaiti2022 performed change detection by calculating the log ratio of backscatter intensity and GLCM texture difference. The process then continued with classification, avoiding two-stage model training and improving overall efficiency.

## Reflection

SAR is now widely used in disaster assessment, including natural and war-related disasters. SAR is characterised by insensitivity to weather conditions, short acquisition cycles and high structural responsiveness. This week’s readings highlighted the importance of intensity ratios and polarization features in SAR-based analysis. The phase is also useful; it can detect slight ground movement. Interferometric SAR (InSAR) techniques have already been used to detect landslides, due to their ability to capture small-scale deformations. [@xue2018]Is it possible to use InSAR to identify localised ground disturbances caused by war (e.g. blast impacts)? Does that mean InSAR can be applied to war damage assessment? Through this week's lecture, I gained knowledge about the importance of remote sensing images in disaster assessment. Automated remote sensing processes can provide disaster damage assessments in the first instance. It provides scientific evidence for the timely allocation of relief resources and thus better reflects the humanitarian spirit. Moreover, the data discussed this week is open-source, and its application helps reduce the development gap between countries. In the future, an open framework for international cooperation on disaster assessment could be developed, which potentially contributes to the scientific coordination of humanitarian aid. Although such ideas face practical challenges such as data privacy and national sovereignty, their potential merits warrant further exploration.
