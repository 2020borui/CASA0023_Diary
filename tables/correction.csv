Correction,purposes /defination,methods,input data,output,Applications
Geometric Correction,"Corrects distortions caused by the sensor or satellites to align the image with the geographic coordinate system, ensuring spatial accuracy.","different transformation types(linear, polynomial, Helmert…)","Pixel coordinates of the original image, GCPs（Ground Control Points, Pixel coordinates of the rectified (gold standard) map",Corrected image,The basis for subsequent georectification and Orthorectification
Atmospheric Correction,Removal of environmental attenuation:Atmospheric scattering and Topographic attenuation,"DOS（Dark object subtraction, PIFs (Psuedo-invariant Features), Py6S, FLAASH, ACORN, QUAC, ATCOR
Empirical Line Correction","radiance reflected above the surface , Atmospheric attenuation",Top-of-atmosphere reflectance and Surface reflectance,Biophysical parameters required and the use of spectral signatures across time and space.
Orthorectification,removing distortions. making the pixels viewed at the nadir (straight down),"Cosine correction, Minnaert correction, Statistical Empirical correction, C Correction (advancing the Cosine)","radiance, Sun's zenith angle, Sun's incidence angle
slope angle (from DEM), slope aspect, solar zenith, solar azimuth",geographically aligned and topography removed,"Orthorectification Is a subset of georectification, useful for Precise Georeferencing and  High-Precision Measurement and Spatial Analysis"
Radiometric Calibration,"Converts the digital value (DN) of an image into a physical sense of radiant brightness or reflectance, eliminating the effects of sensors, light sources, etc.",Lλ = Bias + (Gain * DN),"DN, sensor information, Solar radiation information",Corrected image,"Often used as a first step in data pre-processing to provide a basis for subsequent atmospheric corrections, etc."
