Enhancement,purposes /defination,methods,input data,Advantages,Applicable scenarios
Contrast Enhancement,Improved visualisation of the image by widening the distribution of pixel values.,"Minimum- Maximum
Percentage Linear and Standard Deviation
Piecewise Linear Contrast Stretch",Images with a narrow distributions,Enhance images contrast and details,pre-processing for subsequent classification and visual interpretation
Band Ratioing,Using the ratio of reflectance of different bands to highlight specific feature characteristics,"division operations (like NDVI, NDBI, tasselled cap etc.)",Multi-spectral imagery,Emphasis on relative differences in expression of feature characteristics,"Normalized Burn Ratio, The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI)"
Filtering,Suppressing noise or highlighting local variations through filter operations.,Low pass or low frequency (averages the surrounding pixels)/High pass or high frequency-enhance local variations,Original data,Smooth or sharpen images; extract edge information as required,"Feature extraction, target detection"
PCA,"Dimensionality reduction, removal of inter-band correlations, and extraction of most of the information in the image.",In R this is prcomp() from the terra package,Multi-spectral imagery,Extracting the main direction of change reduces the computational burden and noise reduction,"Data compression, change detection, feature extraction"
Texture,"measuring the relationships between pixel-to-pixel, quantifying roughness to obtain feature characteristics."," GLCM(Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix )
 second-order texture measures,  third-order texture measures","Grey-scale images or single-band data, windows","Characterisation of feature texture, feature classification, target identification","Land cover classification, target detection, environmental monitoring"
Fusion,Fusion of data from different sensors or different times ,"Pan-sharpening, Gram-Schmidt, IHS","Multi-temporal, multi-sensor data",enhance the details of the images,"High resolution data generate, changes detection, data integration"
