# Policy

## Summary

Now, we are against the challenges of a changing climate. Disaster risk reduction (DRR) and sustainable development are important for all cities worldwide. Climate change has led to an increased risk of natural disasters, such as large-scale precipitation, coastal flooding, and sea-level rise, which pose significant challenges to the safety of urban residents and urban infrastructure. According to the projections from NPCC, at the end of the century, the frequency of 100-year floods will be up to 3.6%.

New York as a famous coastal city has hundreds of miles of waterfront and commercial harbours. It will face more emergency crises from flooding. By the 2050s, the sea levels rise in New York are twice the global average, nearly 1 million residents will be influenced by the coastal floodings, some commercial regions will be flooded without protective measures. [@fuleihan] New York has already take many measure to face this emergency, for example, construction of marine parks, widening and elevation of the coastline, enhancement of flood prevention infrastructure, etc.

### International

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development also mentioned climate risk reduction in its reports. It is an important part of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These SDGs build on decades of work by countries and the UN.[@the17g]

**SDG11**: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable

**SDG9**: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation.

Other historical documents and meetings also mention the challenges caused by flooding, such as the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, which provides guidance for disaster prevention and control, the Guidelines for Reducing Flood Losses launched, and the Hyogo Framework for Action (2005-2015).

### Metropolitan

**Livable climate** is also set as a key goal in OneNYC 2050, it proposed 4 relative initiatives for building sustainable cities. The main measures are divided into three directions: Protecting the neighbourhoud and basic infrastructure, effective management measures and more accurate research and forecasting. It also advocates **strengthening communities, buildings, infrastructure, and the waterfront to be more resilient. (21)** To make the city more resilient and safer. The government also collaborated with the U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS to reshape the shoreline of New York.

### Local

At the local level, the city will build according to the adopting flood maps which delineate the climate projections. For example the East Side Coastal Resiliency (ESCR) Project, in Lower Manhattan, the city extends the shoreline to the East River, which will be 20 meters above the current sea level and set up many seafront parks.

In conclusion, current policies are already comprehensive and specific. I think the effectiveness of these initiatives needs to be explored through data methods.

## Application

### Data and Model

Usually, flood hazard mapping always includes two parts: the flood models (FL) and natural catastrophe (CAT) models. [@hirpa2021] Flood models are usually hydrological models based on DEMs, channel locations, stream flow, and precipitation data. The catastrophe models always include land cover data, critical infrastructure, and building footprints extracted from LIDAR data. To support the flood information decision, New York has already drawn a series of maps to inform flood planning and Response. For example, the NYC Stormwater Flood Maps [@nysfloo] shows the area's potential flooding scenarios. New York City now makes flooding monitoring with the help of FloodNet Sensors Which are 87 Low-Cost Ultrasonic sensors, which bring more precision results.

Although the hydrological modelling in the local area seems to be progressively improving perfectly. Remote sensing data is still helpful in emergency response and large-scale analyses of flooding. We can get the depth and extent of the flood by Landsat series data. By computing the modified normalized difference water index (NDWI) to do water detection after floodings. [@cohen2019] We can get flooded areas by comparing it with the Land Cover Dataset. However, Landsat data may be influenced by weather so can not get continuous data. SAR sensors like Sentinel-1 have a higher resolution (10m) and can detect through clouds, so it is more commonly applied to real-time flood monitoring. The flooding analyses estimate the post-to-preflood radar cross-section (RCS) ratio and exclude the double scatterers (DSs) in urban areas.[@mason2023] We can also get the depth of the flood by analysing it in relation to the high-resolution DEM data obtained from LIDAR.

The Land Cover Dataset is important in The Social Vulnerability analyses. We can obtain large area land cover monitoring through optical remote sensing like Landsat, Sentinel-2, and MODIS. Using different indexes helps us detect different types of covering.

```         
NDVI: distinguishes vegetation from non-vegetation.  

NDBI: extracting building area.  

NDWI: extracting body of water.  
```

The DEM Dataset is very important in flooding analyses. It's very important in remote sensing and hydrological analysis. In the local area, we often use LIDAR to get 1-5m DEM data for more precise analyses. For larger study areas like cities, we can use SAR to get DEM data to simplify the dataset for ease of computation.

### Workflows

This workflow shows how data helps address flood-related policy challenges by supporting risk assessment, planning, and effective response measures.

## Reflection

Current NYC Flood Maps may be plots based on hydrologic models developed through hydrologic analyses. New York is a coastal city with many important rivers, the analysis will be difficult because of the different hydrological properties of sea and river water. I think using remote sensing data for analysis is simpler. Because water has the same reflective properties, and the analysis is focused on the results rather than the complex hydrological process. It is more suitable for large-scale analysis across the entire city like New York. Moreover, remote sensing enables long-term monitoring of flood impacts, providing valuable data for evaluating policy effectiveness before and after implementation. For example, New York takes many projects to protect Lower Manhattan and plots the project region and location on the map, reflecting zoning planning, which is very specific and highly instructive.Remote sensing data can provide clear changes before and after the implementation of the policy, and provide support for those projects. A Data-Driven Approach to urban planning analyses data from different scopes with different methods leading to more efficient and accurate policy delivery. 

The methods applied in New York could be adapted for other coastal citiesï¼Œlike Tokyo, Shanghai, which face similar climate challenges. Unlike with radar detectors or precise hydrological data, open-access satellite data (Sentinel-1, Landsat) offers a cost-effective strategy for flood risk analysis and feedback on policy effectiveness, particularly in developing country with limited resources.
