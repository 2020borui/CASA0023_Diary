  abstract = {We compared the performance of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data for forest variable prediction in the boreal forest of Southern Finland. We defined twelve modelling setups to train multivariable prediction models with either multilayer perceptron (MLP) or regression tree models with the brute force forward selection method. The reference data consisted of 739 circular field plots that had been collected by the Finnish Forest Centre concurrently with the Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 acquisitions. The input data were divided into training, validation and test sets of equal sizes for 100 iterations in each modelling setup. The predicted forest variables were stem volume (V), stem diameter (D), tree height (H) and basal area (G), and their species-wise components for pine (Pine), spruce (Spr) and broadleaved (BL) trees. We recorded the performance figures and the best predictive image bands for each modelling setup. The best average performance over the 100 modelling iterations was obtained using all Sentinel-2 bands. The plot-level relative root mean square errors (RMSE\%) of the field observed mean were 38.4\% for average stem diameter, 42.5\% for stem basal area/ha, 30.4\% for average tree height, and 59.3\% for growing stock volume/ha with variables including all tree species. The corresponding best figures with all Landsat 8 bands were RMSE\%\,=\,44.6\%, 50.2\%, 36.6\% and 72.2\%, respectively. The Sentinel-2 outperformed Landsat 8 also when using near-equivalent image bands and Sentinel-2 data down-sampled to 30\,m\,pixel resolution. The relative systematic error (bias\%) did not show any significant differences between Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data: the average of the absolute value of bias\% was 0.8\% for Sentinel-2 and 1.2\% for Landsat 8. The best predictive Sentinel-2 image band was the red-edge 1 (B05\_RE1), when variable totals including all species were estimated. The short-wave infrared bands (B11\_SWIR1 \& B12\_SWIR2) and the visible green band (B03\_Green) were also among the best predictors. The median number of predictors in the best performing models was 4–6 for the Sentinel-2 and 4–5 for the Landsat 8 models, respectively. We conclude that Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) data can be recommended as the principal Earth observation data source in forest resources assessment.},

  abstract = {Monitoring agricultural systems becomes increasingly important in the context of global challenges like climate change, biodiversity loss, population growth, and the rising demand for agricultural products. High-resolution, national-scale maps of agricultural land are needed to develop strategies for future sustainable agriculture. However, the characterization of agricultural land cover over large areas and for multiple years remains challenging due to the locally diverse and temporally variable characteristics of cultivated land. We here propose a workflow for generating national agricultural land cover maps on a yearly basis that accounts for varying environmental conditions. We tested the approach by mapping 24 agricultural land cover classes in Germany for the three years 2017, 2018, and 2019, in which the meteorological conditions strongly differed. We used a random forest classifier and dense time series data from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 in combination with monthly Sentinel-1 composites and environmental data and evaluated the relative importance of optical, radar, and environmental data. Our results show high overall accuracy and plausible class accuracies for the most dominant crop types across different years despite the strong inter-annual meteorological variability and the presence of drought and non-drought years. The maps show high spatial consistency and good delineation of field parcels. Combining optical, SAR, and environmental data increased overall accuracies by 6\% to 10\% compared to single sensor approaches, in which optical data outperformed SAR. Overall accuracy ranged between 78\% and 80\%, and the mapped areas aligned well with agricultural statistics at the regional and national level. Based on the multi-year dataset we mapped major crop sequences of cereals and leaf crops. Most crop sequences were dominated by winter cereals followed by summer cereals. Monocultures of summer cereals were mainly revealed in the Northwest of Germany. We showcased that high spatial and thematic detail in combination with annual mapping will stimulate research on crop cycles and studies to assess the impact of environmental policies on management decisions. Our results demonstrate the capabilities of integrated optical time series and SAR data in combination with variables describing local and seasonal environmental conditions for annual large-area crop type mapping.},

  abstract = {Accurate crop yield estimates are important for governments, farmers, scientists and agribusiness. This paper provides a novel demonstration of the use of freely available Sentinel-2 data to estimate within-field wheat yield variability in a single year. The impact of data resolution and availability on yield estimation is explored using different combinations of input data. This was achieved by combining Sentinel-2 with environmental data (e.g. meteorological, topographical, soil moisture) for different periods throughout the growing season. Yield was estimated using Random Forest (RF) regression models. They were trained and validated using a dataset containing over 8000 points collected by combine harvester yield monitors from 39 wheat fields in the UK. The results demonstrate that it is possible to produce accurate maps of within-field yield variation at 10\,m resolution using Sentinel-2 data (RMSE 0.66\,t/ha). When combined with environmental data further improvements in accuracy can be obtained (RMSE 0.61\,t/ha). We demonstrate that with knowledge of crop-type distribution it is possible to use these models, trained with data from a few fields, to estimate within-field yield variability on a landscape scale. Applying this method gives us a range of crop yield across the landscape of 4.09 to 12.22\,t/ha, with a total crop production of approx. 289,000\,t.},

  abstract = {We present the first comparison of Sentinel-2A (S2) MSI (Multi-Spectral Instrument) and Landsat 8 (L8) OLI (Operational Land Imager) data in the retrieval of forest canopy cover (CC), effective canopy cover (ECC), and leaf area index (LAI). We used S2 and L8 images obtained from Suonenjoki, Finland on 17 and 22 August 2015, respectively. A combination of airborne lidar data and field plots was used to calculate CC, ECC and LAI for a set of 746 systematically placed lidar plots. Generalized additive models were used to link these variables with various types of spectral indices. Our results indicated that instead of using the native image resolution, the model accuracies were better for 60 m lidar plots comprising of nine (S2) or four (L8) image pixels. The best-case absolute root mean square errors of prediction (RMSEPs) (relative RMSEPs shown in parentheses) obtained from ten-fold cross validation of multivariate models for S2 CC, ECC and LAI were 0.126 (24.0\%), 0.100 (20.8\%), and 0.596 (19.6\%), respectively. For L8, the corresponding RMSEPs were 0.128 (24.5\%), 0.108 (22.4\%), and 0.614 (20.2\%). The marginally better performance of S2 models may be related to the 705 nm red edge band, which frequently occurred among the selected predictors. When testing indices that used bands available for both sensors, there were no systematic differences between S2 and L8.},

  abstract = {The advancement in satellite remote sensing technology has revolutionised the approaches to monitoring the Earth’s surface. The development of the Copernicus Programme by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Union (EU) has contributed to the effective monitoring of the Earth’s surface by producing the Sentinel-2 multispectral products. Sentinel-2 satellites are the second constellation of the ESA Sentinel missions and carry onboard multispectral scanners. The primary objective of the Sentinel-2 mission is to provide high resolution satellite data for land cover/use monitoring, climate change and disaster monitoring, as well as complementing the other satellite missions such as Landsat. Since the launch of Sentinel-2 multispectral instruments in 2015, there have been many studies on land cover/use classification which use Sentinel-2 images. However, no review studies have been dedicated to the application of ESA Sentinel-2 land cover/use monitoring. Therefore, this review focuses on two aspects: (1) assessing the contribution of ESA Sentinel-2 to land cover/use classification, and (2) exploring the performance of Sentinel-2 data in different applications (e.g., forest, urban area and natural hazard monitoring). The present review shows that Sentinel-2 has a positive impact on land cover/use monitoring, specifically in monitoring of crop, forests, urban areas, and water resources. The contemporary high adoption and application of Sentinel-2 can be attributed to the higher spatial resolution (10 m) than other medium spatial resolution images, the high temporal resolution of 5 days and the availability of the red-edge bands with multiple applications. The ability to integrate Sentinel-2 data with other remotely sensed data, as part of data analysis, improves the overall accuracy (OA) when working with Sentinel-2 images. The free access policy drives the increasing use of Sentinel-2 data, especially in developing countries where financial resources for the acquisition of remotely sensed data are limited. The literature also shows that the use of Sentinel-2 data produces high accuracies ({$>$}80\%) with machine-learning classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM) and Random forest (RF). However, other classifiers such as maximum likelihood analysis are also common. Although Sentinel-2 offers many opportunities for land cover/use classification, there are challenges which include mismatching with Landsat OLI-8 data, a lack of thermal bands, and the differences in spatial resolution among the bands of Sentinel-2. Sentinel-2 data show promise and have the potential to contribute significantly towards land cover/use monitoring.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an evaluation of the multi-source satellite datasets such as Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with different spatial and temporal resolutions for nationwide vegetation mapping. The random forests based machine learning and cross-validation approach was applied for evaluating the performance of different datasets. Cross-validation with the rich-feature datasets—with a sample size of 390—showed that the MODIS datasets provided highest classification accuracy (Overall accuracy = 0.80, Kappa coefficient = 0.77) compared with Landsat 8 (Overall accuracy = 0.77, Kappa coefficient = 0.74) and Sentinel-2 (Overall accuracy = 0.66, Kappa coefficient = 0.61) datasets. As a result, temporally rich datasets were found to be crucial for the vegetation physiognomic classification. However, in the case of Landsat 8 or Sentinel-2 datasets, sample size could be increased excessively as around 9800 ground truth points could be prepared within 390 MODIS pixel-sized polygons. The increase in the sample size significantly enhanced the classification using Landsat-8 datasets (Overall accuracy = 0.86, Kappa coefficient = 0.84). However, Sentinel-2 datasets (Overall accuracy = 0.77, Kappa coefficient = 0.74) could not perform as much as the Landsat-8 datasets, possibly because of temporally limited datasets covered by the Sentinel-2 satellites so far. A combination of the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 datasets slightly improved the classification (Overall accuracy = 0.89, Kappa coefficient = 0.87) than using the Landsat 8 datasets separately. Regardless of the fact that Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 datasets have lower temporal resolutions than MODIS datasets, they could enhance the classification of otherwise challenging vegetation physiognomic types due to possibility of training a wider variation of physiognomic types at 30 m resolution. Based on these findings, an up-to-date 30 m resolution vegetation map was generated by using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 datasets, which showed better accuracy than the existing map in Japan.},
